8. Cookies & Tracking Technologies

Owlby uses minimal cookies and tracking technologies, only what is essential for platform functionality. We use only essential cookies required for authentication, platform functionality and security, and user preferences. We do NOT use third-party tracking cookies, advertising cookies, or behavioral tracking technologies.

9. Data Sharing & Third Parties

We do not share personal data with third parties for advertising or marketing. For core functionality we use the following essential service providers: Supabase (authentication and database storage) and Google Gemini (AI-powered chat, lessons, and stories). Each is used only as necessary to provide the service and under strict data protection practices.

9.1 Use of Third-Party AI for Chat and Learning

We use Google's Gemini AI service to generate chat responses, lessons, and stories. This is required for Owlby's educational features to work.

What data we send to Gemini:
- Message text (what the user types or says in chat)
- Grade level (for age-appropriate content)
- Brief conversation context (recent messages only, to keep the conversation coherent)

We do not send your name, email address, or other personal identifiers to the AI service. Data sent to Gemini is used solely to generate educational responses and is processed in accordance with Google's terms and privacy practices. You can review Google AI Terms (https://ai.google.dev/terms) and Google Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).

Our broader commitment:
- No personal data shared with advertisers or marketing companies
- No personal data shared with analytics or tracking services
- No personal data shared with data brokers
- All service providers process data only as instructed by us

In the unlikely event of a data breach affecting your personal information, we will notify affected users within 72 hours as required by GDPR, notify parents immediately if children's data is affected (COPPA), and notify relevant authorities as required by law.

12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy with a new "Last updated" date and, where appropriate, by email. Your continued use of the service after changes constitute acceptance of the updated policy.
